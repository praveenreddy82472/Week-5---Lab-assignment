# Hello World Django App
Welcome to my simple Hello World Django app project! This project is a part of a lab where I developed a basic Django app that has one route, which returns a JSON object with a "Hello World" message.

Clone the repository to your local machine.
git clone
Navigate to the project directory
cd hello-world-django
Run the Django development server:
python manage.py runserver
open web browser and visit http://localhost:8000/hello/ to see the Hello World message in JSON format.
